            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For
                example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using
                images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML
                and its functions.</p>
            <p>HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
                HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content
                to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image
                hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For
                example, take the following line of content:

                My cat is very grumpy
                If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in
                paragraph tags:

                <code> < p > My cat is very grumpy < /p ></code> </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element">
            <header>
                <h1>Anatomy of an HTML element</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
            <img
                src="https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2014/11/14/9347/c07aa313dbdd667585430f4eca354dbd/grumpy-cat-small.png">
            <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:

                The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and
                closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case
                where the paragraph begins.
                The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the
                element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add
                a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
                The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
                The element: The opening tag, the closing tag and the content together comprise the element.
                Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
            <img
                src="https://media.prod.mdn.mozit.cloud/attachments/2014/11/14/9345/99516bbeb470af58b608d17bb30e53e6/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png">
            <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual
                content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute
                allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other
                elements with the same class value) with style information and other things.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Nesting_elements">
            <header>
                <h1>Nesting elements</h1>
            </header>
            <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our
                cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a < strong> element, which means that the word is
                    to be strongly emphasized:

                    <code> < p >My cat is < strong >very< /strong > grumpy.< /p ></code>
                    You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example above, we
                    opened the < p> element first, then the < strong> element; therefore, we have to close the < strong>
                                element first, then the < p> element. The following is incorrect:

                                    <code> < p >My cat is < strong >very grumpy.< /p >< /strong ></code>
                                    The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or
                                    outside one another. If they overlap as shown above, then your web browser will try
                                    to make the best guess at what you were trying to say, which can lead to unexpected
                                    results. So don't do it!</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Empty_elements">
            <header>
                <h1>Empty elements</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. Take the < img> element that we already have
                    in our HTML page:

                    <code> < img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image" ></code>
                    This contains two attributes, but there is no closing < /img> tag and no inner content. This is
                        because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in
                        the HTML page in the place it appears.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Lists">
            <header>
                <h1>Lists</h1>
            </header>
            <p>A lot of the web's content is lists and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always
                consist of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:
            <ul>
                <li> Unordered lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a shopping list.
                    These are wrapped in a < ul> element.</li>
                <li> Ordered lists are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. These are
                    wrapped in an < ol> element. </li>
            </ul>
            Each item inside the lists is put inside an < li> (list item) element.</p>
                <p>For example, if we wanted to turn the part of the following paragraph fragment into a list

                    <code> < p >At Mozilla, we’re a global community of technologists, thinkers, and builders working together ... < /p ></code>
                </p>
                <p>We could modify the markup to this

                    <code> < p >At Mozilla, we’re a global community of< /p >
                    
                < ul > <ul>
                 <li> < li>technologists< /li> </li>
                 <li> < li>thinkers< /li></li>
                 <li>< li>builders< /li></li>
                </ul>
                < /ul>
                
                < p >working together ... < /p ></ul></code></p>
